# Implement Epic

Automatically implement all sub-issues of a parent epic in dependency order. Each sub-issue is implemented by a **sub-agent with its own context window**, keeping the main session lightweight for orchestration.

## Input

The user provides a parent issue number: `$ARGUMENTS`

This skill runs autonomously — no confirmation stops between sub-issues.

**HARD BOUNDARIES — NEVER cross these:**
- NEVER merge PRs into `develop` or `main` — those merges are always done by the user
- NEVER close the parent issue (closing happens automatically when the tracking PR is merged)
- Sub-issue PRs into the **feature branch** may be merged freely by sub-agents

## Architecture

```
Main session (orchestrator):
├── Phase 0: Setup — parse epic, determine waves, create feature branch + tracking PR
├── Wave 1 (⚠️ ONE issue in flight at a time — see "Same-wave issues share one working tree" below):
│   ├── Classify issue #A → "implement" or "audit"
│   ├── Spawn background agent (run_in_background: true) — do NOT spawn issue #B
│   │   until #A has fully finished (merged/failed/skipped), even though both
│   │   are in the same wave and `run_in_background: true` makes it *possible*
│   │   to fire both at once
│   ├── Poll progress every 30-45s via /tmp/epic-progress-<N>.txt
│   │   └── Report phase + test results to user in real-time
│   ├── On completion: parse result (SUCCESS/AUDIT_COMPLETE/FAILED)
│   │   — if neither a result NOR a progress-file update arrives for an
│   │   extended period, treat this as a possible silent death: see
│   │   "Sub-agent Liveness & Recovery" below BEFORE re-spawning
│   ├── Handle results: update tracking PR
│   └── (repeat for all issues in wave, ONE AT A TIME)
├── Wave 2-N: same pattern
└── Phase Final: Verification (ALL via sub-agents)
    ├── Agent: Validation & Test Suite
    ├── Agent: Runtime & Smoke Test (containers, API, login)
    ├── Agent: Cross-cutting Auth (conditional)
    ├── Agent: E2E Smoke Test (conditional)
    └── Orchestrator: collect results, sync Closes, show summary
```

The main session NEVER implements code itself. It only:
- Parses the epic and determines execution order
- Spawns background Task agents for each sub-issue
- **Monitors progress via `/tmp/epic-progress-<N>.txt` and reports to user**
- Handles results (success/failure/skip)
- Updates the tracking PR
- Creates bug issues on failure

## Phase 0: Setup

### Step 1: Read parent issue

```bash
~/.claude/bin/gh-save.sh /tmp/epic-$ARGUMENTS.json issue view $ARGUMENTS --json title,body,labels
```

Use the Read tool to read `/tmp/epic-$ARGUMENTS.json`.

### Step 2: Parse sub-issues and implementation order

Parse the issue body for:
- **Sub-issues:** Extract issue numbers from the tracking table or checklist
- **Implementation order:** Look for explicit ordering, dependency info, or phase numbers
- **Dependencies:** Which sub-issues depend on others (from "Depends On", "Blocked by" fields)

### Step 3: Determine waves

Group sub-issues into waves based on dependencies:
- **Wave 1:** Issues with no dependencies (can be implemented first)
- **Wave 2:** Issues that only depend on wave 1 issues
- **Wave N:** Issues that only depend on issues in earlier waves

Issues within the same wave are implemented sequentially (each needs the branch state from the previous).

### Step 4: Prepare project context for sub-agents

Copy all CLAUDE.md files to `/tmp/` so sub-agents can lazy-load them (avoids embedding 20-30 KB of identical context in every sub-agent prompt):

```bash
cp CLAUDE.md /tmp/epic-claude-root.md
cp frontend/CLAUDE.md /tmp/epic-claude-frontend.md 2>/dev/null || true
cp backend/app/CLAUDE.md /tmp/epic-claude-backend.md 2>/dev/null || true
```

Also read the root CLAUDE.md yourself to extract the **one-line tech stack summary** and **test/validation commands** — store these as `project_summary` (max 5 lines). This small summary goes into every sub-agent prompt; the full CLAUDE.md files are read by the sub-agent on demand.

### Step 5: Check/create feature branch

```bash
git fetch origin
git branch -a --list "*issue-$ARGUMENTS*"
```

If the feature branch exists, check it out. Otherwise create it:
```bash
git checkout -b issue-$ARGUMENTS-<description>
```

Store the feature branch name as `feature_branch`.

### Step 6: Check/create tracking PR

Find existing tracking PR:
```bash
~/.claude/bin/find-tracking-pr.sh <repo> $ARGUMENTS
```

If no tracking PR exists, create a draft PR against `develop` using the Write tool to write the body to `/tmp/tracking-pr-body.md`, then:
```bash
gh pr create --draft --title "<Epic title>" --base develop --body-file /tmp/tracking-pr-body.md
```

Store the tracking PR number as `tracking_pr`.

### Step 7: Show overview and start

Display a summary of:
- Total sub-issues and wave structure
- Dependency graph
- Feature branch and tracking PR

Then proceed immediately — no confirmation stop.

## Phase 1-N: Per Wave

Process each wave sequentially. Within each wave, process sub-issues sequentially.

### Same-wave issues share one working tree — never spawn them in parallel

All sub-agents for one epic operate on the **same local clone** (the feature
branch's working directory), even when their target sub-issue is independent
and has no logical dependency on its same-wave sibling. `run_in_background:
true` only means the orchestrator doesn't block waiting for the agent — it
does NOT give that agent an isolated filesystem. Two sub-agents racing
`git checkout -b`, editing the same generated files (`app/models/__init__.py`,
migration sequence numbers), or committing while the tree is mid-checkout by
a sibling WILL corrupt each other's branches. This has happened repeatedly in
practice: a commit landing on the wrong branch, a stray import/column leaking
from one issue's uncommitted edit into another's, an alembic revision number
collision.

**Rule: spawn one sub-agent per wave, wait for it to fully resolve (merged,
failed-and-bug-filed, or explicitly skipped) before spawning the next — even
within the same wave, even when the two issues are logically independent.**
This applies regardless of how many issues the wave logically permits in
parallel; the wave grouping is about *dependency order*, not about spawn
concurrency.

If wall-clock time matters enough to accept the added setup cost, an
alternative is **one git worktree per sub-agent** (`git worktree add
<path> <sub-branch>`) instead of sharing the main clone — each agent then
truly has its own filesystem and parallel spawns are safe. This is more
complex to wire (worktree creation/cleanup, base-branch sync into each
worktree) and is not the default; only reach for it if sequential wall-clock
time is a demonstrated problem for a specific epic.

### Per sub-issue:

#### Step 1: Prepare the feature branch

Before spawning the sub-agent, ensure the feature branch is up to date:

```bash
git checkout <feature_branch>
git pull origin <feature_branch>
```

#### Step 2: Fetch issue details and classify

```bash
~/.claude/bin/gh-save.sh /tmp/sub-issue-<N>.json issue view <N> --json title,body,labels
```

Use the Read tool to read `/tmp/sub-issue-<N>.json`. Store the issue title, body, and labels.

**Classify the issue as `audit` or `implement`:**

An issue is an **audit** issue if ANY of these match:
- Title contains: "review", "audit", "scan", "check", "verify", "assessment"
- Labels include: `security` combined with words like "review" or "audit" in the title
- Body focuses on verification/scanning rather than code changes (checklist of things to check, not things to build)
- The issue explicitly says "no code changes" or "document findings"

An issue is an **implement** issue if it requires writing/changing application code (adding middleware, creating endpoints, modifying configuration, etc.).

**When in doubt:** classify as `implement` — it's better to write code and discover it's an audit than to only audit when code was needed.

#### Step 2b: Detect auth impact

Scan the issue body for auth-related keywords: `status`, `UserStatus`, `role`, `permission`, `auth`, `login`, `PENDING`, `SUSPENDED`, `DELETED`, `BLOCKED`, `INACTIVE`.

If any keywords are found, mark the issue as `auth_impact: true`. This flag is used in Step 3A to inject an additional auth impact check into the sub-agent prompt.

#### Step 3: Spawn sub-agent via Task tool

Use the Task tool with `subagent_type: "general-purpose"` and `run_in_background: true`. The sub-agent gets its own context window and full tool access.

**The prompt depends on the issue classification.**

---

##### Step 3A: Prompt for `implement` issues

```
Implement GitHub issue #<N> for epic #$ARGUMENTS.

## Issue
Title: <title>
Body: <full issue body>

## Project Context
<project_summary — max 5 lines: tech stack, test command, validation command>

Project policies are in these files — read them BEFORE writing code:
- /tmp/epic-claude-root.md (project overview, naming conventions, dev commands)
- /tmp/epic-claude-frontend.md (frontend architecture — read if modifying frontend)
- /tmp/epic-claude-backend.md (backend architecture — read if modifying backend)
Read only the files relevant to your issue. Do NOT skip this step.

## Branch Setup
- Feature branch: <feature_branch>
- Create sub-branch: issue-<N>-<description>
- Base your work on the feature branch (already checked out)
- If this issue's body references another sub-issue's output (a column, a
  function signature, a shared module) as already existing, verify that
  assumption against the ACTUAL current state of the feature branch
  (`git log <feature_branch> --oneline`, `Read`/`Grep` the real file) before
  writing code or tests against it — a same-wave sibling's PR may not have
  merged yet even if its issue number is mentioned as a dependency. If the
  referenced thing genuinely isn't there yet, treat it as blocked and report
  that in your FAILED response rather than writing tests that assert a
  not-yet-true state.

## Instructions

1. Create and checkout branch: `git checkout -b issue-<N>-<description>`
2. Read the codebase: use Glob, Grep, Read to understand relevant files.
   **For E2E/Playwright tests:** also read the frontend components you are writing selectors for. Never guess heading text, aria-labels, CSS classes, or DOM structure — look them up in the React/Vue/Svelte source. Grep for the component name, read it, and extract the exact strings and attributes you need for locators.
3. Implement the changes following the project policies above
4. Write tests following the Test Quality Policy
5. **Commit and push incrementally — do not save it all for the end.**
   Commit as soon as a coherent block works (endpoint + its tests green → commit;
   component + its tests green → commit). **Push right after your FIRST commit**
   so the work exists remotely even if you die mid-task, and keep pushing after
   each later commit:
   `~/.claude/bin/git-commit.sh "concise descriptive message"` then
   `git push -u origin issue-<N>-<description>`
   Multiple commits in the PR are fine and expected — a tidy single commit is not
   worth the risk. A sub-agent can die silently (no error, no FAILED response),
   and everything not yet pushed is lost; agents that had pushed lost nothing,
   agents that had not lost hours of work. This is the single highest-value habit
   in this prompt.
6. Run ONLY the tests relevant to your changes — NEVER the full test suite:
   `~/.claude/bin/project-test.sh tests/unit/test_<relevant>/ -v`
   The full suite and project validation run after all sub-issues are done — not here.
7. If tests fail: fix and retry (up to 3 attempts total)
8. If tests pass:
   - Commit any remaining uncommitted work: `~/.claude/bin/git-commit.sh "concise descriptive message"`
   - Write PR body to /tmp/pr-body.md using the Write tool, then push + PR + merge in one command:
     `~/.claude/bin/git-push-pr-merge.sh --base <feature_branch> --title "<title>" --body-file /tmp/pr-body.md`
   - This script pushes, creates the PR, waits for the CI checks, merges it, and returns to the feature branch automatically
   - The gate **fails closed**: it merges only on positive evidence that every check is green. Expect each sub-PR to take 1-2 minutes longer than a blind merge, and expect blocks where a red branch used to slip through silently — that is the gate working.
   - **If the script exits non-zero with `STATUS: CI_GATE_BLOCKED`:** the PR was left open. Read the `CI_GATE:` line to see why:
     - `FAIL — <check names>` → those checks are red. Investigate (`gh pr checks <PR_NUMBER>`, CI logs), fix at root cause, commit, push to the same branch.
     - `TIMEOUT — still pending: <check names>` → checks never finished. Check whether the run is stuck or the queue is slow before retrying.
     - `FAIL — no checks appeared after <N>s` → no check ever registered. Either the workflow file is broken (fix it), or the repo genuinely has no CI — in that case, and only then, re-run with `--no-ci-wait`.
     - `FAIL — unable to verify checks` → `gh` itself failed. Verify auth/rate limits; do not work around it by disabling the gate.
     - Then re-run `~/.claude/bin/git-push-pr-merge.sh` with the same arguments to re-trigger the gate. The script reuses the open PR, so re-running is safe and does not create a duplicate.
     - Up to 3 fix-and-retry attempts; if still blocked, leave the PR open and report the blocker instead of forcing a merge

## Auth Impact Check (only include if auth_impact is true)
This issue changes user status/role/auth fields. BEFORE writing tests:
1. Read auth/dependencies.py (or equivalent auth guard file)
2. Check which statuses/roles the guard currently allows
3. Determine: should the NEW status pass the guard or be blocked?
4. Write a test that verifies this explicitly
5. If the new status SHOULD pass but the guard blocks it: note this in the PR body as a required follow-up

## Playwright E2E Test Account Checklist (only for projects using Playwright)
If this issue creates or modifies Playwright E2E tests that require test accounts, ensure ALL THREE files are in sync:
1. `tests/e2e/fixtures/test-accounts.ts` — TS fixture with key, email, tier, storageState
2. `playwright.config.ts` — project entry with testMatch and storageState path
3. The Python seed script (e.g. `backend/app/scripts/seed_e2e_accounts.py`) — account with matching key, email, tier, and person data
Missing any one of these three causes global-setup to fail with a login error at test runtime.

## HARD BOUNDARIES
- Your PR target is the FEATURE BRANCH (`<feature_branch>`) — NEVER target `main` or `develop`
- NEVER close any issues — that happens automatically when the tracking PR is merged by the user
- Your scope is ONE sub-issue only — do not touch other issues or the tracking PR

## Tool Rules
- Use Glob/Grep/Read instead of Bash equivalents (find, grep, cat, head, tail)
- Use Write/Edit for file creation and modification — not Bash (echo, cat, sed, awk)
- Bash is for: git, gh, npm, docker, and `~/.claude/bin/` scripts only

## Progress Reporting

Write your current phase to `/tmp/epic-progress-<N>.txt` using the Write tool at each milestone.
Format (one line per field, only PHASE is required):

PHASE: <milestone-name>
DETAIL: <optional context>
TESTS: <passed>/<total> passed, <failed> failed

Milestones to report (update the file BEFORE starting each phase):
- READING_CODEBASE — when you start exploring files. DETAIL: which directories/files
- WRITING_TESTS — when you start writing test code. DETAIL: number of test classes/cases
- RUNNING_TESTS_RED — after running tests that should fail. TESTS: 0/8 passed, 8 failed
- IMPLEMENTING — when writing production code. DETAIL: which files you're modifying
- RUNNING_TESTS_GREEN — after running tests that should pass. TESTS: 8/8 passed, 0 failed
- COMMITTING — when staging and committing. DETAIL: number of files staged
- CREATING_PR — when pushing and creating PR
- MERGING_PR — after merging the PR. DETAIL: PR number

This is critical for the orchestrator to track and report your progress to the user.

## Execute — do not describe or delegate

You are the agent that does this work. There is no other agent for you to hand off to, wait for, or monitor. If any part of this prompt mentions other issues running in the background, other sub-agents, or the orchestrator's monitoring loop, that is context about the SURROUNDING system, not an instruction for you to adopt the same posture. Read the codebase, write the code, run the tests, commit, push, open the PR — actually perform every step below. Do not respond with a description of what you would do, a status update about "the agent" (there is no other agent — you ARE the agent), or a message implying you are waiting for something else to finish. A response that does not contain actual tool calls performing this issue's work is a failure to follow this prompt.

## Response Format

Respond with EXACTLY one of these formats ONLY once you have actually completed (or genuinely exhausted attempts at) the implementation work above — not as a status update, not as an intermediate report, and never in place of doing the work:

SUCCESS:
PR_NUMBER: <number>
SUMMARY: <one-line description of what was implemented>
FILES_CHANGED: <count of files added or modified>
TESTS_WRITTEN: <count of test functions written>
TESTS_PASSED: <passed>/<total>

FAILED:
ERROR: <description of what went wrong>
ATTEMPTS: <what was tried>
LAST_ERROR_OUTPUT: <relevant error output>
```

---

##### Step 3B: Prompt for `audit` issues

Audit issues do NOT produce code or PRs. They scan the codebase and post a report as a comment on the issue.

```
Perform a security audit for GitHub issue #<N> (part of epic #$ARGUMENTS).

## Issue
Title: <title>
Body: <full issue body>

## Project Context
<project_summary — max 5 lines: tech stack, test command, validation command>

Project policies are in these files — read them BEFORE starting your audit:
- /tmp/epic-claude-root.md (project overview, naming conventions)
- /tmp/epic-claude-backend.md (backend architecture, security patterns)
Read only the files relevant to your audit domain. Do NOT skip this step.

## Audit Instructions

You are performing a security AUDIT — your output is a structured report, NOT code changes.

1. Read the issue body carefully to understand which security domain to review.
2. Determine which domain this issue covers. Use the mapping below:

   - "dependency" / "dependencies" / "npm audit" / "pip-audit" → Run: `~/.claude/bin/deps-audit.sh`
   - "authentication" / "authorization" / "JWT" / "auth" → Review auth code: Glob for `**/auth/**`, read security.py, dependencies.py, permissions.py
   - "input validation" / "OWASP" / "XSS" / "SQL injection" → Search for injection patterns: raw SQL, dangerouslySetInnerHTML, subprocess, eval, user-controlled URLs
   - "file upload" / "photo" / "image" → Review upload handlers: Glob for `**/upload*`, `**/photo*`, check MIME validation, size limits, processing
   - "security headers" / "HTTP headers" / "CSP" / "HSTS" → Run: `~/.claude/bin/security-headers-check.sh <target-url-if-known>` and review middleware config
   - "rate limit" / "throttle" / "brute force" → Search for rate limiting: Grep for `rate_limit`, `throttle`, `slowapi`, `RateLimiter`. Map which endpoints are protected
   - "database" / "SQL" / "mass assignment" → Review ORM usage, check for raw SQL, verify sensitive fields excluded from responses
   - "infrastructure" / "secrets" / "Docker" / "session" / "cookie" → Run: `~/.claude/bin/secret-scan.sh` + `~/.claude/bin/env-audit.sh` + `~/.claude/bin/docker-audit.sh`
   - "pentest" / "ZAP" / "penetration" → Run: `~/.claude/bin/owasp-zap-scan.sh <target-url>` (only if a target URL is available, otherwise note it requires a running target)

3. Perform the domain-specific audit:
   - Run applicable `~/.claude/bin/` scripts
   - Use Glob, Grep, Read to systematically review relevant code
   - For each finding, record: severity (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW/INFO), file:line, description, remediation

4. Generate the audit report in this format:

```markdown
## Security Audit Report: <domain>

**Issue:** #<N>
**Date:** <today>
**Auditor:** Claude Code (automated)

### Executive Summary
<1-3 sentences: overall assessment>

### Findings

| # | Severity | Finding | File | Remediation |
|---|----------|---------|------|-------------|
| 1 | HIGH | ... | path:line | ... |

### Detailed Findings
<per finding: description, evidence, fix>

### Verified Controls
<what was checked and found secure — audit trail>

### Recommendation
<PASS / PASS WITH WARNINGS / FAIL>
```

5. Post the report as an issue comment:
   - Write report to `/tmp/security-audit-report-<N>.md` using the Write tool
   - Post: `gh issue comment <N> --body-file /tmp/security-audit-report-<N>.md`

## Tool Rules
- Use Glob/Grep/Read instead of Bash equivalents (find, grep, cat, head, tail)
- Use Write/Edit for file creation and modification — not Bash (echo, cat, sed, awk)
- Bash is for: git, gh, `~/.claude/bin/` scripts only

## Progress Reporting

Write your current phase to `/tmp/epic-progress-<N>.txt` using the Write tool at each milestone.
Format (one line per field, only PHASE is required):

PHASE: <milestone-name>
DETAIL: <optional context>

Milestones to report (update the file BEFORE starting each phase):
- SCANNING_CODEBASE — when you start reviewing code. DETAIL: which directories
- RUNNING_AUDIT_SCRIPTS — when running audit scripts. DETAIL: which script
- ANALYZING_RESULTS — when processing results. DETAIL: findings count so far
- WRITING_REPORT — when writing the report. DETAIL: total findings and critical count
- POSTING_REPORT — when posting the comment

This is critical for the orchestrator to track and report your progress to the user.

## Execute — do not describe or delegate

You are the agent that performs this audit. There is no other agent for you to hand off to, wait for, or monitor. If any part of this prompt mentions other issues running in the background or the orchestrator's monitoring loop, that is context about the SURROUNDING system, not an instruction for you to adopt the same posture. Actually scan the codebase, run the audit scripts, write the report, and post the comment — perform every step below. A response that does not contain actual tool calls performing this audit is a failure to follow this prompt.

## Response Format

Respond with EXACTLY one of these formats ONLY once you have actually completed (or genuinely exhausted attempts at) the audit above — not as a status update and never in place of doing the work:

AUDIT_COMPLETE:
FINDINGS: <number of findings>
CRITICAL: <number of critical findings>
RECOMMENDATION: <PASS / PASS WITH WARNINGS / FAIL>
SUMMARY: <one-line summary>

FAILED:
ERROR: <description of what went wrong>
ATTEMPTS: <what was tried>
LAST_ERROR_OUTPUT: <relevant error output>
```

#### Step 3C: Monitor sub-agent progress

**⚠️ TOOL RULE: Use the Read tool to read progress files and TaskOutput to check agent status. NEVER use Bash commands like `tail`, `cat`, `grep`, or `head` for monitoring — these will be blocked by permissions and stall the epic.**

After spawning the background sub-agent:

1. Store the `task_id` from the Task tool response
2. **Poll every 30-45 seconds** until the agent completes:
   a. Use the **Read tool** on `/tmp/epic-progress-<N>.txt` (ignore if file doesn't exist yet — agent is still starting)
   b. Parse the `PHASE:`, `DETAIL:`, and `TESTS:` fields
   c. **Report to the user** with a human-readable status message:
      ```
      ⏳ #<N> (<title>): <human-readable phase>
      ```
      - If TESTS line is present, append: `— X/Y passed, Z failed`
      - If DETAIL line is present, append in parentheses: `(modifying auth_service.py)`
   d. Call `TaskOutput` with `block: false, timeout: 1000` to check if the agent is done
   e. If not completed → continue polling (next iteration ~30-45s later)
   f. If completed → extract the result text and proceed to Step 4
   g. **If the progress file hasn't advanced across 2-3 consecutive polls AND `TaskOutput` returns "No task found with ID"** → the sub-agent has died silently (a process-level failure, not a task-level FAILED response). Do not treat this the same as an active FAILED result. Follow "Sub-agent Liveness & Recovery" below before re-spawning anything.

**Two false-alarm sources to avoid when judging liveness:**

- **Never use repo file mtimes as a liveness signal** (e.g. `find backend/ frontend/ -newermt '...'`). Under the sandbox this returns nothing while the agent is demonstrably editing files — it will report a healthy agent as dead. The progress file is the signal; `TaskOutput` is the proof.
- **A silent progress file is not by itself proof of death.** An agent making a large edit or thinking through one spot can go a long time without hitting a milestone — the progress file only advances at milestones, not continuously. This is why the `TaskOutput` check in (g) is required, not optional: without that confirmation, treat silence under ~25 minutes as "still working". If you ever monitor on silence alone, use ~40 minutes as the threshold, and run the clock from when you *started watching*, not from the mtime left behind by a previous (dead) agent — otherwise the timer fires the instant you restart.

### Sub-agent Liveness & Recovery

A sub-agent can die mid-task without ever sending a completion notification or writing a final progress line — the task ID simply stops resolving via `TaskOutput`. This is distinct from a `FAILED` response (which is an active, intentional report) and distinct from "still working, hasn't hit a milestone yet" (a fresh agent may take several minutes before its first progress-file write). Do not assume either of the other two cases — verify.

**Also watch for a second, different failure signature:** a sub-agent that terminates after only 1-2 tool calls with a vague, self-referential, non-implementing response (e.g. "the agent is running in the background, I'll wait for it to complete") instead of actually doing the work or returning SUCCESS/FAILED. This is not a silent death — it sent a normal completion notification — but it is equally a non-result: no branch, no commits, no PR. Detect it the same way as a silent death (check `git log`/`git status` on the expected branch) since the response text alone is not trustworthy signal that real work happened.

**When either signature is suspected, before concluding anything is lost:**

1. Call `TaskOutput` with `block: false` on the task ID. If it errors with "No task found", the process is confirmed gone (not just slow).
2. Check the expected sub-branch for real work, in this order:
   - `git log <expected-sub-branch> --oneline -5` — did it commit? Compare against the feature branch tip to see if there are new commits.
   - `git branch -a | grep <N>` — does a remote-tracking branch exist (was anything pushed)?
   - `~/.claude/bin/gh-save.sh` + `gh pr list --search "<N> in:title"` — was a PR already opened?
   - `git status --short` on the **currently checked-out branch** — same-wave sub-agents share one working tree (see above), so a dead agent's uncommitted work may be sitting on whatever branch happens to be checked out right now, not necessarily its own sub-branch.
3. **Never discard uncommitted work found this way.** If real, relevant changes are sitting uncommitted:
   - `git stash push -u -m "orphaned #<N> work from dead sub-agent: <short description>"` — never `git checkout --` or `git clean` a dead agent's edits.
   - Note the stash reference so it can be referenced when re-spawning.
4. If a sub-branch has zero commits (identical tip to the feature branch) and nothing was stashed for it, it is safe to delete (`git branch -d <sub-branch>`) before re-spawning — nothing is lost.
5. **Re-spawn** with an explicit note in the prompt:
   - State plainly that a previous attempt died and this is a fresh attempt.
   - If a stash exists, point to it by name/message and say it MAY be inspected for reference (`git stash show -p stash@{N}`) but must not be blindly applied — treat it as unverified, not a starting point to resume from.
   - If the second failure signature (confused non-response) was the trigger, add an explicit instruction to actually perform the implementation and not just describe or delegate it (see the hardened Response Format instruction below).
6. After a sub-agent DOES complete successfully following a recovery, verify no stale duplicate files are left on the shared working tree from the dead attempt (`git status --short`) — diff any untracked leftovers against the new committed version; if byte-identical, they are safe to `git clean` away; if they differ, investigate before removing.

3. **Phase display mapping** (use these human-readable labels):

   | Progress file value | Display to user |
   |---|---|
   | READING_CODEBASE | Analyzing codebase |
   | WRITING_TESTS | Writing tests |
   | RUNNING_TESTS_RED | Running tests (RED phase) |
   | IMPLEMENTING | Writing implementation |
   | RUNNING_TESTS_GREEN | Running tests |
   | REFACTORING | Refactoring |
   | COMMITTING | Committing changes |
   | CREATING_PR | Creating pull request |
   | MERGING_PR | Merging PR |
   | SCANNING_CODEBASE | Scanning codebase |
   | RUNNING_AUDIT_SCRIPTS | Running audit scripts |
   | ANALYZING_RESULTS | Analyzing results |
   | WRITING_REPORT | Writing report |
   | POSTING_REPORT | Posting report |
   | DONE | Complete |

4. **On completion**, report the final result to the user before proceeding:
   - For implement: `✅ #<N> — <summary> | PR #<pr> | <files> files | <tests_passed>/<tests_total> tests`
   - For audit: `🔍 #<N> — <summary> | <findings> findings, <critical> critical | <recommendation>`
   - For failure: `❌ #<N> — Failed: <error summary>`

#### Step 4: Handle sub-agent result

Parse the sub-agent's response:

**On audit complete** (response contains `AUDIT_COMPLETE`):
- Extract findings count, critical count, recommendation, and summary
- Record: issue #N → 🔍 Audited (<recommendation>)
- If recommendation is PASS: mark as ✅ in tracking PR
- If recommendation is PASS WITH WARNINGS: mark as ⚠️ in tracking PR
- If recommendation is FAIL: mark as ❌ in tracking PR, create follow-up issue for critical findings
- No PR is created for audit issues — the report is posted as an issue comment by the sub-agent

**On success** (response contains `SUCCESS`):
- Extract PR number, summary, files changed, tests written, and tests passed
- Record: issue #N → ✅ Complete, PR #X

**On failure** (response contains `FAILED`):
1. **Create bug issue** — write body to `/tmp/bug-epic-<N>.md`:

```markdown
## Context
- Epic: #$ARGUMENTS
- Sub-issue: #<N> — <title>
- Feature branch: <feature_branch>

## Error
<error from sub-agent response>

## What Was Attempted
<attempts from sub-agent response>

## Last Error Output
<last_error_output from sub-agent response>

## Suggested Next Steps
- Investigate the error manually
- Check if dependencies are correctly set up
```

```bash
gh issue create --title "🐛 [Epic #$ARGUMENTS] Bug: <description>" --label bug --body-file /tmp/bug-epic-<N>.md
```

2. **Clean up failed branch** (if it was pushed):

```bash
git checkout <feature_branch>
git branch -D issue-<N>-<description>
```

3. **Mark dependent issues as skipped** — any issue in later waves that depends on this failed issue cannot proceed. Track which issues are skipped and why.

#### Step 5: Update tracking PR

After each sub-issue (success or failure), update the tracking PR:
- Update status in the tracking table (✅ Complete, ❌ Failed, ⏭️ Skipped)
- Update progress percentage
- Add PR link for successful issues
- Add bug issue link for failures

Write updated body to `/tmp/tracking-pr-update.md`, then:
```bash
gh pr edit <tracking_pr> --body-file /tmp/tracking-pr-update.md
```

## Phase Final: Verification & Wrap-up

**CRITICAL: NEVER merge PRs into `develop` or `main`. NEVER close the parent issue. NEVER push to `main` or `develop` directly. The tracking PR stays as a draft for the user to review and merge manually.**

**CRITICAL: Phase Final runs ALL verification steps as sub-agents.** The orchestrator's context is depleted after polling waves of sub-issues. Each verification step gets a fresh context window to do its job properly. The orchestrator only collects results and builds the summary.

### Step 1: Spawn verification sub-agent — Validation & Tests

Spawn a background agent:

```
## Task: Project Validation & Test Suite for Epic #<epic_number>

You are verifying the feature branch `<feature_branch>` after all sub-issues have been merged.

Project policies are in these files — read them BEFORE starting:
- /tmp/epic-claude-root.md (project overview, dev commands)
- /tmp/epic-claude-backend.md (backend architecture — if backend changes)
- /tmp/epic-claude-frontend.md (frontend architecture — if frontend changes)

### Step 1: Run project validation

```bash
git checkout <feature_branch>
npm run validate:all
```

If validation fails, fix issues and commit directly to the feature branch.

**Before committing anything here, check WHAT the validation changed.** Chains
like `validate:all` typically end in a formatter and a code generator, and both
WRITE to the tree. That churn is unrelated to the epic (regenerated API specs
often differ only in unicode escaping), and this step is the one place the
instruction above says to commit directly to a shared branch — so it is exactly
where churn gets committed under a plausible-looking message.

```bash
git status --short          # anything you did not touch on purpose?
git diff --stat             # churn is usually a large diff in a generated file
```

Revert generated-file churn (`git checkout -- <file>`) and commit only real
fixes. If the diff is genuine (you changed a backend schema), regenerate
deliberately and say so in the commit message.

Scope the effort to what the epic actually touched: a check that cannot fail
because of this epic's diff is wall-clock, not evidence. If the whole epic was
frontend-only, the backend validators and the throwaway backend venv rebuild
prove nothing — prefer the project's scoped variant where one exists.

### Step 2: Scoped regression tests

Do NOT run the full test suite — sub-agents already ran their relevant tests.
Instead, run only test files related to files changed by the epic:

1. Get changed source files (not tests):
```bash
git diff develop..<feature_branch> --name-only -- '*.py' '*.ts' '*.tsx' | grep -v test
```

2. For each changed source file, find related test files using Glob/Grep:
   - `backend/app/services/foo_service.py` → `backend/tests/**/test_foo*`
   - `backend/app/api/foo.py` → `backend/tests/**/test_foo*`
   - `frontend/src/pages/FooPage.tsx` → `frontend/src/**/__tests__/Foo*`

3. Run ONLY those test files with a generous timeout (tests may take minutes per file):
```bash
~/.claude/bin/project-test.sh <test-file-1> <test-file-2> ... -v
```
Use `timeout: 600000` (10 minutes) on the Bash call.

4. **CRITICAL — test run management:**
   - NEVER start a new test run if a previous one is still running or timed out. If Bash times out, the tests are still running in the background — do NOT launch another run (this causes parallel test suites competing for DB connections).
   - If the Bash call times out: report WARN with "tests still running after timeout, likely too many test files scoped" and stop. Do NOT retry.
   - If tests fail: check if failures are pre-existing (run same test on develop). Only fix regressions introduced by this epic.

### Step 3: Report

Write progress to `/tmp/epic-verify-validation.txt`:

PHASE: RUNNING_VALIDATION / RUNNING_TESTS / FIXING / DONE
DETAIL: <what's happening>

## Response Format

VALIDATION_COMPLETE:
VALIDATE_ALL: PASS/FAIL — <details>
TEST_SUITE: PASS/FAIL — <passed>/<total> tests (scoped to changed files)
FIXES_COMMITTED: <number of fix commits, 0 if none>

FAILED:
ERROR: <description>
```

### Step 2: Spawn verification sub-agent — Runtime & Smoke Test

Spawn a background agent:

```
## Task: Runtime Verification & Smoke Test for Epic #<epic_number>

You are verifying that the application works at runtime after all sub-issues for epic #<epic_number> have been merged into `<feature_branch>`.

Project policies are in these files — read them BEFORE starting:
- /tmp/epic-claude-root.md (project overview, dev commands)

### Step 1: Rebuild containers if dependencies changed

Check if dependency files were modified:

```bash
git diff develop..<feature_branch> --name-only | grep -E "(package\.json|package-lock\.json|requirements\.txt|pyproject\.toml|uv\.lock)"
```

If any dependency file changed:
- Frontend: `cd backend/docker && ./stop.sh && ./start.sh`
- Backend only: `docker restart pam_api`
Wait for containers to be healthy: `~/.claude/bin/wait-for-healthy.sh pam_api`

### Step 2: Container health check

```bash
~/.claude/bin/docker-health-check.sh [project-dir] [--filter PREFIX] [--timeout SECS]
```

If containers are down or unhealthy:
1. Run `cd backend/docker && ./stop.sh && ./start.sh`
2. Wait 15 seconds, re-check
3. After 1 failed retry: report failure but continue

### Step 3: API smoke test

```bash
~/.claude/bin/smoke-test.sh [base-url] [--health-token TOKEN]
```

### Step 4: Migration check (if alembic detected)

- Run `docker exec pam_api alembic current` and verify no errors
- Check `docker logs pam_api --tail 20` for migration failures
- If migrations failed: investigate and fix

### Step 5: Login smoke test

Use the project's API login script to verify a test account can log in:
```bash
./scripts/api-login.sh admin
```
If it fails with 502/500: the API is broken — investigate container logs.

### Step 6: Report

Write progress to `/tmp/epic-verify-runtime.txt`:

PHASE: REBUILDING / HEALTH_CHECK / SMOKE_TEST / MIGRATION_CHECK / LOGIN_TEST / DONE
DETAIL: <what's happening>

## Response Format

RUNTIME_COMPLETE:
DEP_REBUILD: PASS/SKIP — <details>
CONTAINERS: PASS/WARN/FAIL — <X/Y healthy>
API_HEALTH: PASS/WARN/FAIL — <details>
MIGRATIONS: PASS/WARN/FAIL — <current vs head>
LOGIN_TEST: PASS/FAIL — <details>

FAILED:
ERROR: <description>
```

### Step 3: Spawn verification sub-agent — Cross-cutting auth (conditional)

**Only spawn if any sub-issue was marked `auth_impact: true` in Phase 1-N.**

```
## Task: Cross-cutting Auth Verification for Epic #<epic_number>

You are checking that new user statuses or roles introduced by epic #<epic_number> are properly handled by existing auth guards.

### Step 1: Find new statuses/roles

Search the feature branch diff for new statuses/roles:
```bash
git diff develop..<feature_branch>
```
Look for: enum additions (Python `class ...Status`, `ALTER TYPE ADD VALUE`), new role constants, new permission levels.

### Step 2: Verify auth guards

For each new status/role found:
- Read the auth guard (e.g., `auth/dependencies.py`)
- Check if the guard explicitly handles the new status
- Write a targeted test that creates a user with the new status and verifies expected behavior

### Step 3: Run tests

```bash
~/.claude/bin/project-test.sh <test-file> -v
```

If tests fail: fix on the feature branch and commit.
If no new statuses/roles found: report SKIP.

## Response Format

AUTH_CHECK_COMPLETE:
NEW_STATUSES: <list or "none found">
RESULT: PASS/FAIL/SKIP — <details>
```

### Step 4: Spawn verification sub-agent — E2E Smoke Test (conditional)

**Skip if the epic is a pure backend/infrastructure change with no user-facing effect.**

```
## Task: E2E Smoke Test for Epic #<epic_number>

You are writing and running a minimal Playwright smoke test to verify that the UI changes from epic #<epic_number> work at runtime.

Project policies are in these files — read them BEFORE starting:
- /tmp/epic-claude-root.md (project overview)
- /tmp/epic-claude-frontend.md (frontend architecture, testing patterns)

### Step 1: Determine the epic's UI domain

Based on the epic scope, classify what area was touched:

| Epic domain | Auth needed? | What to test |
|---|---|---|
| Public pages (landing, pricing, legal) | No | Pages load, content renders |
| Auth flow (login, register, password) | No | Forms render, validation works |
| Profile/search/matching | Yes (test account) | Key pages load, data displays |
| Admin panel | Yes (admin account) | Admin pages load, tables render |

### Step 2: Write a targeted smoke test

Create `tests/e2e/<epic-domain>-smoke.spec.ts`

Read the actual frontend components you are writing selectors for — never guess headings, aria-labels, or DOM structure.

Keep it minimal:
- Each touched page/route loads without errors
- Key content visible (headings, data)
- No JavaScript console errors

### Step 3: Run the smoke test

```bash
npx playwright test tests/e2e/<epic-domain>-smoke.spec.ts --project=<project-name>
```

If tests fail: fix and retry once.

### Step 4: Commit the smoke test

The smoke test is a permanent artefact — commit it to the feature branch.

## Response Format

E2E_COMPLETE:
DOMAIN: <epic domain>
TESTS: <passed>/<total>
COMMITTED: true/false

FAILED:
ERROR: <description>
```

### Step 5: Collect results and show summary

Wait for all verification sub-agents to complete (use `TaskOutput` with `block: true`). Parse each result.

**Sync Closes statements:** Ensure all completed sub-issue numbers are in the tracking PR body as `Closes #<N>` statements. Failed and skipped issues should NOT have Closes statements.
