# Pre-tool-use hook: refuse a PR body that would fail a checklist status gate.
#
# Some repositories label agent-opened PRs and run a CI gate that requires a
# marked checklist section in the PR body, with every box ticked. When the
# section is missing the check only goes red minutes later, after the push has
# already landed. This hook runs the same logic locally, before the `gh` call,
# so the failure is immediate and legible.
#
# It covers `gh pr create` AND `gh pr edit` — the second path is easy to forget
# and is how tracking PRs are usually updated.
#
# The failure this prevents is not a forgotten section but a plausible-looking
# heading with invented items: that passes a gate which only counts ticked
# boxes, while quietly replacing the reviewed checklist with something else.
# A heading cannot satisfy this hook, which is the point.
#
# Generic by design: every repo-specific value is configuration. Point it at a
# project with a small wrapper that exports the variables below and execs this
# script (see the example at the bottom).
#
# Configuration (environment variables):
#   CHECKLIST_REPO_MATCH   Case-insensitive extended regex matched against the
#                          `--repo owner/name` argument. Required.
#   CHECKLIST_PATH_MATCH   Glob matched against $PWD, used when the command has
#                          no --repo. Optional; no PWD fallback if unset.
#   CHECKLIST_CMD_MATCH    Extended regex selecting the commands to inspect.
#                          Default: bare `gh pr create|edit`. Override when the
#                          project opens PRs through a wrapper script: the
#                          wrapper's own name never contains `gh pr create`, so
#                          the default silently skips the very call that needs
#                          checking.
#   CHECKLIST_START        Opening marker. Default: <!-- AGENT-REVIEW:START -->
#   CHECKLIST_END          Closing marker. Default: <!-- AGENT-REVIEW:END -->
#   CHECKLIST_TEMPLATE     Template path quoted in error messages.
#                          Default: .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
#   CHECKLIST_HINT         Optional extra sentence appended to the
#                          missing-markers message (e.g. why the listed items
#                          are a floor and must not be swapped out).
#
# Installation: register in settings.json under PreToolUse / matcher "Bash".
# Register the project wrapper, not this script directly:
#   { "type": "command", "command": "~/.claude/bin/<project>-check-agent-review.sh" }
#
# Example wrapper:
#   #!/usr/bin/env bash
#   export CHECKLIST_REPO_MATCH='[^ ]*/myrepo\b'
#   export CHECKLIST_PATH_MATCH="$HOME/src/myrepo*"
#   exec ~/.claude/bin/hook-check-agent-review.sh
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 = allow
#   2 = block (reason to stderr, shown to Claude)
